 Change is slow and gradual
 Patience and Persistence Calm and Composure win the race Sometimes you need to start running before you can walk
 Where there is a will there is a way
 Do not go asking for a favor before doing your Homework

 Do not ask a question before Googling it
 The more you code the sooner you become and Engineer
 No. of projects matters
 The Lion's limitless endurance, aggressiveness and heart power it on and on
 The more you learn the more you earn
 Closing your eyes and sitting for sometime = Meditation
Human Tongue is a double edged sword only a handful master
 If I have to chop down a tree in 6 hrs, I will spend the first 4 sharpening the saw
 Take your time. Never stop learning
 Conquer the mountain by cracking

 I keep preparing and my opportunity will come
 I'm built from every mistake I've ever made
 The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
 Meditation = Recharge
  If you can do one you can do many
